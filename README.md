# ybw-abm

This repository includes the codes that are used for the development of an agent-based model (ABM) within Netlogo and the codes used for the data acquisition. The aim of this ABM is to simulate the migration of the Yellow-browed Warbler (Phylloscopus Inornatus) from their breeding grounds in Siberia, via Northwest Europe, towards their wintering grounds in Southwest Europe and Northwest Africa. The decision-making process of the bird-agents for this migration will be steered via a combination of internal and external factors.
