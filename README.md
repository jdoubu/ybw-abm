This repository includes the codes that are used for the development of an agent-based model (ABM) within Netlogo and the codes used for the data acquisition. The research objective of this ABM is to simulate the migration of the Yellow-browed Warbler (Phylloscopus Inornatus) from their breeding grounds via Europe towards their wintering grounds.
